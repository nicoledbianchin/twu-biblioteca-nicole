# twu-biblioteca-nicole

This repository contains the biblioteca assignment for the pre ThoughtWorks University course. Is a simple application with Java 8 and JUnit tests, builded with TDD and trying to apply clean code principles. It represents a library management system.

## Running
The application is a command line interface. It runs in the ```BibliotecaApp.java``` class, in the root of the project. You can:
 - See the list of books and movies available;
 - Checkout a book or a movie;
 - Return a book or a movie;
 - Create a profile with your contact information (name, email and phone number);
 - Se you contact information in the library;
 - As a librarian, you can login with pre-determined credentials and see which person has checked out which book or movie;
 
 ## Next steps
 Having a deadline to deliver the exercise, I made sure all the requirements were met (you can see the issues in the project in this repository), but there are still space to improvements. Some of them are:
  - Add exceptions handler to handle with inappropriate inputs from the user.
  - Refactor the tests using Mockito (both for improving the code and exercising the using of the library).
  - Improve the interface.
  - Encode the librarian login.
